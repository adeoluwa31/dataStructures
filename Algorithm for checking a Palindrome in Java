Algorithm to check whether a word is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word that reads forwards and backwards simultaneously.
steps to checks are written below:
Step1: Declare and Initiatalize a variable to be stored as a string
Step2: Then a condition is created to check a group of words
Step3: Then within the condition we create a boolean to check whether word is a palindrome
Step4: A true or false value is returned after a word is checked to be a palindrome
Step5: As output the word checked states that the word is palindrome
